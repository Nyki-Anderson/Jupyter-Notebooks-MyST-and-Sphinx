# Jupyter-Notebooks-MyST-and-Sphinx

This project has started to splinter into many topics including using Jupyter Notebooks, MyST Markdown, and Sphinx to document and publish technical documents; building a custom Jupyter kernel; and automated build environments.

See the [docs/](./docs/notebooks/) folder for in-depth tutorials on how to set up this environment, publish Jupyter Notebooks in professional formats for the web (HTML) and print (PDF *using LaTeX*).
