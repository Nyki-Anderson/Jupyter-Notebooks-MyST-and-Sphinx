    "I found when starting the [Lua Programming Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/10a9Qq3@bsv9B0_-y2oIqI8dNeFs0eOv7PG5VL1JESM-yN0Mw9HtaVPeFRODH5bI3g_TOZw=/) that the stock `xeus-lua` kernel was not dynamic enough to allow so-called _magic_ commands offered by the IPython Kernel. Specifically, I could not run the `lua` code as files that receive user input. \n",
