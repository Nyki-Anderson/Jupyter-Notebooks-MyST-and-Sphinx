<h1>The Goal: A Publishing Environment for Static HTML &amp; LaTeX PDF<a class="headerlink" href="#the-goal-a-publishing-environment-for-static-html-latex-pdf" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to streamline the publishing process for professional-quality scientific reports, books, and documentation. For these purposes, we will be using <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">MyST Markdown</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx Documentation</a>. These tools will serve as the backbone to our metadata-rich content, bringing depth and accessibility to the final products (a static HTML site and accompanying PDF book).</p>
<p>Whether you are just hearing of these tools or are looking to sharpen some skills, this tutorial will do its best to thoroughly improve your scientific deliverables.</p>
<p>Let’s get a sense of scope before we drill in.</p>
<div class="admonition-objectives admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Objectives</p>
<p>There are many facets to this project, in this chapter, we will only concern ourselves with the big picture. Our main objectives by the end of this project will be to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Publish Jupyter Notebooks using MyST Markdown and Sphinx Documentation as tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a reproducible python environment that is fully configured with metadata and extensive documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement custom design elements such as admonitions, support for emojis, widgets, and interactive content.</p></li>
<li><p>Streamline the pipeline to as few commands as possible for continuous deployment.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<section id="the-results">
<h2>The Results<a class="headerlink" href="#the-results" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>By the conclusion of this tutorial you will be able to build and replicate an environment capable of publishing beautiful static websites and professional PDFLaTeX-rendered documents. Dozens of built-in HTML themes and granular control over the LaTeX formatting make for an endless sandbox of options but the stock design tools produce elegant results by themselves.</p>

<h4>Folder Contents<a class="headerlink" href="#folder-contents" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The basic structure of the final build directory is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docs</span></code> : This is the content folder and contains several other folders that make up the content that is to be converted and the content that is delivered.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code> : Inside this folder is where you will find either the LaTeX output or the HTML scripts.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">source</span></code> : Probably th most important folder, this is where content is kept and configuration <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.yml</span></code>s housed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_notebooks</span></code> : You may have guessed it but this is our content folder. Any <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.md</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rst</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pynb</span></code> files that need to be rendered by Sphinx should be kept in here.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_static</span></code> : Static assets like images and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.js</span></code> are stored here for easy reference by the content.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_templates</span></code> : Any template files should be kept in this folder, though we don’t make use of any throughout this tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_config</span></code> : This file could be replaced with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">myst.yml</span></code> as they contain the same key:value pairs but I have yet to decide how I want to handle this.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conf.py</span></code> : The most important configuration file, it contains all the directives for Sphinx and its integrations with the other apps. All extensions, file inclusions/exclusions, formatting, etc. are defined within.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">index.rst</span></code> : This is the <strong>main</strong> configuration file as it determines what is captured by the rendering process in a structure called the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">toctree</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make.bat</span></code> :</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lib</span></code> : This contains any dependencies and packages that are needed for the environment including an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">environment.yml</span></code> file with all the packages installed by the virtual <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span></code> environment that controls the whole build.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">node_modules</span></code> : Contains the build packages for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">node.js</span></code> though we don’t make use of them in this tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scripts</span></code> : Two <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bash</span></code> scripts are necessary to bring everything together with one command. (More on these soon.)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">share</span></code> : This is where we store the files that derive any custom kernels we build or install.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src</span></code> : The interpreters for the kernels are kept here.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">package.json</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">package-lock.json</span></code> : These two files maintain the versions of all node packages and describe the project.</p></li>

<h2>The Road Ahead<a class="headerlink" href="#the-road-ahead" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a pretty massive undertaking when I think about the path that has led me to this point in the project. This project started out as research for another project that involved <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lua.org/docs.html">lua</a> programming language and <a class="reference external" href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">Pandoc</a> exporting. Through much trial and error, I can say that I prefer this solution though it does not directly apply to the application I had before which was to export my <a class="reference external" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Home">Obsidian vault</a> files to PDF elegantly (though it seems within the realm of possibility).</p>
<p>Still, it has been massively rewarding to go through this process and I hope by sharing it with you, it can make an impact on your productivity too. Here’s a look ahead.</p>
<section id="the-environment-a-local-conda-installation">
<h3>The Environment: A Local <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span></code> Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-environment-a-local-conda-installation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will utilize <a class="reference external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/download">Anaconda</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/">Miniconda</a> package manager <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/">conda</a> for the majority of our environment build. We will of course automate the installation of packages though I will mention a few significant ones more critically. Automation will come in the form of very minimal bash scripting –though I must mention it was much more involved when I was building the <a class="reference external" href="https://xeus-lua.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">xeus-lua kernel</a> from source.</p>
<p>As new packages are found necessary, the running version control file, <a class="reference download internal" download="" href="../_downloads/1d18f6b09c9492d12160d731b57dbdfc/environment.yml"><span class="xref download myst">lib/environment.yml</span></a> will need to be updated accordingly. Keeping this running “log” of what is being installed is what makes this project so valuable in the long run because you are going to want a portable installation that can adapt to whatever your next publication need is.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-configuration-integrating-three-tools-into-one">
<h3>The Configuration: Integrating Three Tools into One<a class="headerlink" href="#the-configuration-integrating-three-tools-into-one" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This will, by far, be the most time consuming section to cover, as it took me days to come to the correct solution for integrating all three tools. There is extensive documentation –as you might guess– for all three of these programs but there are significant holes in communication as far as where configuration directives can legally be called and exactly where to put the files when you figure it out.</p>
<p>Folding in all three tools was a challenge, made all the harder by the fact that I opted to keep the installations local rather than use something like JupyterLab which actually has MyST Markdown preview capabilities. I stuck with that decision because I wanted to be able to control exactly how much unfinished content was “out there” on a server. I imagine using these tools to publish and finalize rather proprietary information at some point and I wanted to know how to do it in house before considering security implications.</p>
<div class="admonition-staying-local admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Staying Local</p>
<p>Staying local also meant I got to keep using VS Code which runs Jupyter Notebook natively and does the best job out of any IDE I’ve ever used at maintaining a cohesive workspace. Not to mention the ability to use the command line right within the application itself. And while most of the VS Code extensions cannot reach the Jupyter kernel directly, most of the perks of the Jupyter Notebook UI are available through the command prompt.</p>
</div>
<p>As far as the configuration files go themselves, they are written in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.yml</span></code> mostly with a few exceptions. The Sphinx configuration file is a python script called <a class="reference download internal" download="" href="../_downloads/fb0d0d7ff27f33697ba3b787ec894677/conf.py"><span class="xref download myst">conf.py</span></a>, the <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html"><span class="std std-doc">index.rst</span></a> is written in reStructureText (a derivative of Markdown), and there are a couple versions of a <a class="reference download internal" download="" href="../_downloads/24f75eabab1fe4730ed764eb3a94b2a7/Makefile"><span class="xref download myst">Makefile</span></a> –or<a class="reference download internal" download="" href="../_downloads/c4f93c697b5cb1f6f7e8546c0496eb2b/make.bat"><span class="xref download myst">make.bat</span></a>– to bring it all together. Details are best left to that respective chapter.</p>

<section id="the-deployment-publishing-our-work-in-its-finest-format">
<h3>The Deployment: Publishing Our Work in its Finest Format<a class="headerlink" href="#the-deployment-publishing-our-work-in-its-finest-format" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This was probably the most frustrating part of the whole process because it was dependent on a lot of tools and techniques that I’ve never used before. The greatest difficulty came in the form of learning <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions and Workflows</a> –or rather, not learning– how to deploy to GitHub Pages in that way. I also experimented with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Read the Docs</a> deployment which is still tied to a GitHub repository but carries its own documentation and workflows. I found this method much less transparent than the pure GitHub method and eventually found the simplest tutorial ever. In this chapter, we will explore the various methods and how they are supposed to work.</p>
<p>There is also some value in refining the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PDFLatex</span></code> workflow so that it is more customized to the document itself rather than full of assumptions and errors. I find that this method of publishing is more in the wind than the HTML export and that’s because LaTeX is programmatically structured rather without the benefits of the linear progression and infinite scroll of a website. Still, the approach as it stands currently has quite the payoff and is something I am excited to share.</p>

<section id="project-expansion">
<h2>Project Expansion<a class="headerlink" href="#project-expansion" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This project could see a lot more content as an addendum in the future. I see many ways to improve the pipeline and certainly more ways to get value out of the capabilities of all three tools. Jupyter Notebooks intrigues me as a likely replacement –or at least equally tempting option– for use as my go to note-taking app. I love Obsidian more than most people love their children and have made tremendous growth in terms of Plugin integration and authorship but it doesn’t seem to be as refined or elegant as Jupyter.</p>
<p>Further, as I start to embark on legitimate research that I might wish to share with the world, I can tell that Sphinx will be a long time friend. I do enjoy making tutorials about the things I learn so publishing in this format will certainly be a step up from the dreaded GitHub <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docs</span></code> repositories I’ve come accustomed to submitting.</p>
<p>This project could evolve even before it is done being written as there were many loose ends that I just had to move away from because they were too far outside the scope of the immediate project. But I would potentially like to address them within the same tutorial as addenda. These topics include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Developing a custom Jupyter kernel with the capability of running both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xeus-lua</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shell</span></code> commands or at least the potential to make use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IPython</span></code> magic commands.</p></li>
<li><p>Building a full-service GitHub repo that can be installed using a simple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bash</span></code> script. The project is close on delivering this kind of universality but I am not quite sure how much further I would need to take it, so more research is required.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrating a more flexible <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">node.js</span></code> kernel capable of running insecure web applications from within the Jupyter Notebook with a tool like OWASP-ZAP for performing penetration testing. I found a couple of tutorials on this topic and it is certainly on my radar as a possible alternative to using Docker for the same purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning up the repository and environment install so that it is leaner and faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement custom admonitions with graphic much like the native-MyST Markdown flavored admonitions.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="closing-remarks">
<h2>Closing Remarks<a class="headerlink" href="#closing-remarks" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is still uncertain how many, if any of these topics I will be able to cover in this tutorial before another project takes precedent. But if any of these sound more useful than others, do not hesitate to reach out in the comments of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Nyki-Anderson/Jupyter-Notebooks-MyST-and-Sphinx.git">this repo</a>.</p>
