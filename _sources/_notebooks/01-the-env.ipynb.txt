    "# The Environment: A Local `conda` Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can start in with the actual coding, let's get our ducks in a row. This chapter will focus on installing, building, and fine-tuning our development environment, all of which will run on a `Python` virtual environment. This will be done locally for a number of reasons which may all become clear later in the [Why A Virtual Environment?](#why-a-virtual-environment). All of this will allow us to use a `python3.12` kernel for use within the Jupyter Notebook interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Objectives\n",
    "The aim of this chapter is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fully characterize the set of packages, tools, and other considerations that are required for Jupyter Notebook to function properly throughout its use.\n",
    "- Determine what (if any) limitations we will have when developing a build-time script for a local `conda` virtual environment vs. installing our full build into the `base` environment.\n",
    "- Automate the build process with a single command and test that environment is equivalent to the one we develop initially.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup is fairly specific to the exact tools and their versions, though I did not have any issues that required me to downgrade any packages. Though, keep this detail in mind throughout the project, as any deviations could potentially break the build.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using VS Code's local version of the Jupyter Notebook software but little configuration is necessary on that front. \n",
